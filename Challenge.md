# Challenge

## Mission Debrief

Since you have done the experiment, now your challenge is to try other classification algorithm and publish the model as web service. 


## Trying other classification model

You can just add another classification model and try it out by dragging from left panel and connect it the same way you connect with multiclass decision forest. 

Sample are like below :

## Publish as a web service

You can easily publish the experiment as web service so other service can use the model. This will be useful so whenever new log text coming, 
you can connect it to the webservice and predict the severity level. You can click "Publish as Web Service" to start converting your experiment to predictive project. 

Tips : Make sure you only need to input the text and id. Adjust the web input model to a place that only accepting text and id.
